# FreeProve

FreeProve is collaborative platform for checking mathematical proofs.


## Description

Nowadays proof proof in mathematics falls on the shoulders of academic researchers. These researchers are often involved in their research work and it is often difficult for them to find time to go through end-to-end proof.  Therefore, the proof-checking process can take a long time, and the number of times they will verify the correctness of the proof is limited.  As a result, the number of proofs that 'humanity' is willing to check is smaller than the number of proofs that 'humanity' can produce.

### Solution
Open the proof-checking process to a large number of people who are not necessarily from the academy (similar to Wikipedia where the editors are not necessarily from the academy). And let each check one logical claim from complete proof.

### Explain the solution
Proof is a series of logical claims, each of which is either an axiom, or derives from its predecessor through inference rules. The process of checking evidence can be performed by many 'checkers', each of whom checks a small number of claims so that none of them checks the proof from end to end (indeed it has already happened that several researchers have checked one proof).
 FreeProve will conduct an evidence-checking process via the Internet - the checking will be performed by a huge number of 'checkers' so that each 'checker' can 'Confirm', 'Reject' or 'Don't Know' any single claim. When The FreeProve will see that all claims are confirmed and confirms the complete proof.
 Anyone can register as a checker . In addition, anyone can write computer software that will also be used as 'checkers'. FreeProve will determined the level of reliability of each checker by comparing the results of the 'checkers'.
